            Top Ten Tips for... Delivering a Great Training Session</h2>
        <p class="postDetails" style=" top: 50%;  position: fixed; ">
            The benefits of training in the workplace are undeniable - it's a great way to boost morale, re-focus your team and enhance and develop your employees. So, how can you make sure you're delivering a training session that's truly beneficial for your team and your business?

Read on for our Top Ten Tips...

1. Tell your delegates what they can expect in advance
Start your training session off on the right foot by ensuring everyone in attendance knows what they can expect from the day. Whether you reach out to every delegate beforehand with an itinerary or simply incorporate an in-depth introduction into your programme, it is important that your trainees know what points will be covered within the session and what they can expect from the day.

2. Use all the senses
It is a well-known fact that everyone finds it easier to learn in different ways. Some may be visual learners while others prefer hands-on experience. Try and incorporate as many different learning styles into your session, you could even get creative and use different sounds or food and drink to emphasise the key points in your programme.

3. Demonstrations and practical activities
Similarly to the point above, you may lose the attention of some of your delegates if you simply stand there and recite information from a PowerPoint presentation. How can you make the training more hands-on? Get your trainees involved in practical demonstrations or activities and they are more likely to remember your key points and gain a greater understanding of the subject matter.

4. Test what they have learnt so far
Incorporating tests and quizzes into your training session is also a great way to ensure your attendees play extra close attention to the material. Particularly if you have a lot of information to get through, break it up into smaller chunks and follow each module with some quiz questions. This is a great way for you to determine whether your training session is having the desired results.

5. Involve your trainees
Throughout the session, ask your trainees to share their experiences with the training topic. Many of your delegates will be experienced personnel who have valuable information to contribute and they are likely to get more out of the session by hearing about their co-workers experiences. Hearing different voices will also keep the day varied and interesting.

6. Do not be afraid to repeat yourself
It is good practice to get into the habit of repeating questions before you answer them. Whether these are questions you are asking the group or queries from the trainees, this simple trick will ensure that all participants know what the question is so they can make sense of the answer.
